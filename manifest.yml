name: HeatSinkSIM
description: |-
  **HeatSinkSIM** solves the heat transfer problem for a vertically oriented, plate
  fin heat sink operating under natural convection. Heat transfer is analyzed
  using conduction, convection and radiation.

  Two levels of analyses are available:

  - Level 1 analyzes a range of heat sink designs to identify optimum heat sink
    designs
  - Level 2 provides a detailed analysis of the optimum heat sink design and is
    automatically recommended when predicted temperatures approach component
    operating limits.
